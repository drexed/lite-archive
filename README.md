## Configurations

`rails g lite:archive:install` will generate the following file in your application root:
`config/initalizers/lite_archive.rb`

```ruby
Lite::Archive.configure do |config|
  config.all_records_archivable = false
  config.sync_updated_at = true
end
```

## Usage

An `archived_at` column must be added to tables where you that you want to archive.
If the table does not have this column, records will be destroyed instead.

#### Table create
```ruby
class AddArchivedAtColumn < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :table_name do |t|
      t.timestamp                # Adds archived_at automatically if all_records_archivable
      t.timestamp archive: true  # Adds archived_at timestamp
      t.timestamp archive: false # Does NOT add archived_at timestamp
    end
  end
end
```

#### Column migration
```ruby
class AddArchivedAtColumn < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :table_name, :archived_at, :datetime # Manual column (null constraint must be false)
    add_timestamp :table_name                       # Named column helper (equivalent to the above)
  end
end
```

## Methods

#### Instance
```ruby
user = User.first
user.archive     #=> Archives the User record and its dependents
user.unarchive   #=> Unarchives the User record and its dependents
user.to_archival #=> Returns the User archival state locale string (ex: Archived)
```

#### Class
```ruby
User.archive_all   #=> Archives all User records and their dependents
User.unarchive_all #=> Unarchives all User record and their dependents
```

## Scopes

```ruby
User.archived.all   #=> Returns only archived records
User.unarchived.all #=> Returns only unarchived records
```

## Callbacks

#### Before
 ```ruby
 class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   before_archive :do_something
   before_unarchived :do_something
 end
```

#### After
 ```ruby
 class User < ActiveRecord::Base
   after_archive :do_something
   after_unarchive :do_something
 end
```
